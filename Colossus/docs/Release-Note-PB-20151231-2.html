<h3>December 31, 2015: Public Build #2</h3>
<p />
New build just to get two small improvements into use
<p />
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug reported by Dantitan, that one could not propose own new game, as long as a game
    in which was earlier playing was still ongoing</li>
</ul>
No, it wasn't the last one; this one here is.

<h1>Release Notes for the Public Build from December 31, 2015</h1>

<p />
New build just to get two small improvements into use
<p />

<ul>
<li>Visual feedback when splitting und unsplitting legions (so that in case response from 
    server takes long, people do not right away try to do it 'once again'</li>
<li>An option to have locally 'Only own legions' mode</li>
</ul>
This is probably the last build for this year...
