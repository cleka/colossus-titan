<h1>Release Notes for the Public Build from December 15, 2015</h1>

<p />
Beside the corrections/improvements listed below, also some "behind the scenes" changes 
related to the "no-battleboard-problem", reconnecting, suspend-and-resume, etc., 
including stuff that should help me to troubleshoot those issues better.
<p />
<ul>
<li>Autosave begin of each phase, also after mulltigan and extra-roll, and between engagements</li>
<li>Suspend now with and without saving possible</li>
<li>When resuming a game fails, it is now properly put back to list of suspended games, instead of being lost</li>
<li>Fixed: after drift damage creatures that can strike were not highlighted</li>
<li>Fixed: now it shows really the total creature points, not same as creature count line; changed label of 'Points' to 'Creature-Points'</li>
<li>Masterboard window title now shows as first thing the owning player</li>
</ul>
