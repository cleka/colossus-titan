    <title>Colossus: Release Note for Colossus Public Build 20151111</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>
<h1>Release Notes for the Public Build from November 11, 2015</h1>

This includes also the information from previous build, because there was no build
note for that. Last Build Notes/RecentChangesDetails listing was done with Release 0.14.0 (September 17, 2013)

<h3>November 11, 2015: Public Build</h3>
<p />

<p />
Polished the Inactivity-Autoplay and Turn-xx-yellow functionality that were added earlier, and some new ones:
<ul>
<li>Inactivity timeout and "turn-xx-yellow" should now work more reliably/consistently<br> 
    Both can be disabled in Preferences. The yellow is now also reset to normal when game is over</li>
<li>Possibility to suspend games and resume later. Main purpose for that is that one could
    hopefully recover from crashed/stuck (no BattleBoard) situations, by restarting/resuming
    game from last auto-save point (at the moment that means begin of each turn; begin of 
    each phase and perhaps between engagements is almost working)</li>
<li>Requested/suggested by Scotty: Having easier access to players creature points and player type:<br>
	<ul>
	<li>added player type and creature points to game status window,</li> 
    <li>allow multiple PlayerDetails dialogs to be open and kept open at same time,</li> 
    <li>and a refresh button added there</li>
    </ul>
<li>For dice rolls, using random data from random.org instead of Java's built-in PRNG 
    (actually, this has been in effect since November 2nd).</li>
<li>A "Contact Admin" feature</li>
<li>Reverted/dropped the requirement Java 7. In fact Java 7 is ATM the worst choice, since it's likely that it is the 
    culprit for game/application sometimes being stuck.<br><b>If you can, us Java 5, 6 or 8 instead!</b></li>  
</ul>
<p />

<h3>August 5, 2015: Public  Build</h3>
<p />
Added several features, improved usability and in general some corrections.
<p />
Part of those were already in use since the Public Test Build from July 10.
<ul>

<li>Inactivity-timeout (or rather "inactivity-autoplay"") added: if a user does really
    nothing for some time (while it is on him to do something, including responding to
    flee/concede dialog when being attacked), the Client's autoplay will kick in and
    finish his turn   
<li>When the own turn starts, one is now also notified by that, that the bottom bar
    of the MasterBoard and the chat background turn yellow (that they both can be disabled
    has been added in the following release)   
<li>Probability-based battle hits</li>
<li>Extra-roll requests</li>
<li>Added that /ping now sends feedback to sender that one really did send this via ping</li>
<li>History-functionality in chat window (Cursor up-down)
<li>Several small improvements to AI (mostly about protecting Titan) provided by BrentNZ. Thanks!</li>
<li>Display marker count in split phase (also by BrentNZ)</li>
<li>Writes battle dice rolls statistics to a text file (idea is that players can
    access it via a web browser but that's not done yet)</li>
<li>Layout changes to WebClient propose games tab (window was too tall for some wide-screens)</li>
<li>Added tool-tip text for some more columns in proposed game table</li>
<li>Provide the various game options (that were so far only available in local games) also in web games</li>
<li>Improved error handling for illegal recruiting</li>
<li>Visual feedback for Done on BattleBoard to prevent "illegally called ..." cases</li>
<li>Removed display of hostname in GetPlayers dialog (could lead to a long delay
    during application start if one has 2 network interfaces)</li>
</ul>
